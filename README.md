# Persistent Stuff

Saves your toggle sprint (sprinting/walking), hitboxes' (enabled/disabled), chunk borders' (enabled/disabled) states across Minecraft restarts. Never toggle these at startup again.
And a feature to keep your sprint/sneak toggled after dying on `1.20+`.

Support for `1.19.x` has been dropped, because this mod is effectively complete and the new feature is only relevant on `1.20+` anyway.

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), optionally requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for configuration.
